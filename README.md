# ChatGPT-wrapper-swiftui

This is a simple ChatGPT wrapper app that does basic chat transaction with OpenAI's LLM models. 

This code is largely based on Jared Davidson's instruction youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkg3UzopiHY) with some adjustment like loading animation, typing animation and auto-scrolling, scrolling button to mimimc ChatGPT iOS app's design. 

<h3>Important</h3>

You need to acquire OpenAI's API key here https://platform.openai.com/ in order to make this app functioning and get package dependancy from MacPaw https://github.com/MacPaw/OpenAI . Just downloading and running this code won't make chat experience working.
